  <h1>ETL Developer Interview Grid</h1>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Job Requirement</th>
        <th>Response / Talking Points</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>ETL pipeline design and maintenance</td>
        <td>I’ve designed scalable ETL pipelines using SSIS and shell scripting, optimizing workflows for reduced load times and robust error handling. In one case, I cut pipeline latency by 35% using parallel processing techniques.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Data extraction from legacy systems</td>
        <td>I've led data migrations involving legacy systems like Kronos and Cornerstone into Workday HCM. My strength lies in reverse-engineering undocumented data flows and building repeatable extraction routines.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Workday HCM data mapping</td>
        <td>I’m well-versed in Workday’s data schemas—especially for HCM—and have mapped over 100+ data fields from disparate legacy formats during a recent onboarding and compensation module migration.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Validation and data quality assurance</td>
        <td>Data integrity is foundational. I apply multi-pass validations—referential checks, null constraints, and business logic assertions—combined with SQL scripts and Python-based reconciliation.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Performance optimization</td>
        <td>I’ve tuned SSIS data flows and database queries using indexes, partitions, and stored procedure rewrites to support sub-second response times on high-volume reports.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Documentation and process transparency</td>
        <td>Every ETL solution I deliver comes with modular documentation: data dictionaries, mapping specs, transformation rules, and business logic annotations for future audits and onboarding.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Testing and scripting</td>
        <td>I build automated unit and integration test scripts as part of every ETL deployment. Bash and PowerShell are my go-tos for runtime orchestration and log validation.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>ETL tool experience (SSIS, Informatica, Talend)</td>
        <td>I’ve worked primarily with SSIS, but I’ve also adapted logic for Talend and Informatica environments—especially during cross-tool transitions between vendors.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>SQL proficiency</td>
        <td>SQL is second nature—from writing recursive CTEs for hierarchical data to tuning window functions for BI dashboards. I write performant, maintainable code that scales with volume.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Unstructured data integration</td>
        <td>I’ve parsed semi-structured sources like XML and JSON from third-party APIs, transforming them for relational storage and analytical rereporting in SSAS cubes.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Stakeholder collaboration</td>
        <td>I act as the bridge between engineering and business teams—translating KPIs and HR requirements into technical mappings and transformation logic.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Training and facilitation</td>
        <td>I’ve built onboarding materials and hosted technical walkthroughs for junior engineers and non-technical HR staff—simplifying workflows and empowering data ownership.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Education & experience</td>
        <td>I hold a B.S. in Computer Science, and have 6+ years of ETL experience including 3 years dedicated to Workday HCM migrations, with extensive exposure to Kronos and Cornerstone.</td>
      </tr>
