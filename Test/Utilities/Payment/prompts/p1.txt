Please add a new tab to the page titled "Dual Payment Form". This tab should contain a form that:
- Collects the following fields:
- Recipient Name
- Payment Amount
- Memo/Note
- Optional: Payment Reference ID
- On submission:
- Assembles a URL that includes the form data as query parameters.
- Injects the same form data into both CashApp and Zelle payment details.
- Displays two buttons:
- Pay with CashApp → opens a prefilled CashApp URL with the entered data.
- Pay with Zelle → opens a prefilled Zelle URL or triggers the appropriate action with the same data.
Please ensure:
- The form is responsive and styled to match existing tabs.
- The data is mirrored exactly between both payment methods.
- The tab is export-friendly for PDF if needed.
