        <p1>42 CFR 93.236 as it pertains to Information Technology Use in Clinical Research:<br>
            <br>
        Detailed Aspects of 42 CFR 93.236<br>
        Research Records:<br>
        <br>
        Definition: This includes all records that document the planning, conduct, and outcomes of clinical research. This can encompass raw data, processed data, clinical study reports, laboratory records, informed consent forms, and more.<br>
        <br>
        Electronic Records:<br>
        <br>
        Authenticity: Electronic records must be created, maintained, and retrieved in a way that ensures they are genuine and have not been altered.<br>
        <br>
        Integrity: The integrity of the data must be preserved. This means ensuring that the data remains complete, accurate, and reliable over time.<br>
        <br>
        Confidentiality: Adequate measures must be in place to protect the privacy of research subjects and the confidentiality of research data.<br>
        <br>
        Access and Security:<br>
        <br>
        Access Control: Implement strong access control measures to ensure that only authorized personnel can access electronic records. This includes using unique user IDs, strong passwords, and role-based access controls.<br>
        <br>
        Audit Trails: Maintain detailed audit trails that record who accessed the records, what changes were made, and when these changes occurred. This helps ensure accountability and traceability.<br>
        <br>
        Data Encryption: Use encryption to protect sensitive data, both in transit and at rest, to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.<br>
        <br>
        Backup and Recovery: Implement regular backup procedures to ensure that data can be recovered in case of accidental deletion or data loss. Regularly test backup and recovery processes to ensure they work as intended.<br>
        <br>
        Regulatory Compliance:<br>
        <br>
        Validation: Validate electronic systems and software used in clinical research to ensure they function correctly and comply with regulatory requirements.<br>
        <br>
        Training: Ensure that all personnel involved in the handling of electronic records are trained on GCP guidelines, relevant regulations, and the organization's policies and procedures.<br>
        <br>
        Documentation: Keep detailed documentation of all processes, procedures, and controls related to the creation, maintenance, and security of electronic records. This documentation should be readily available for regulatory inspections.<br>
        <br>
        Importance of Compliance Monitoring<br>
        Compliance monitoring helps ensure that clinical research is conducted ethically and in accordance with all applicable regulations. It protects the rights and well-being of research participants, maintains data integrity, and enhances the credibility of research findings.<br>
